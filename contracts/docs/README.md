## Overview

Arcane Game is a sophisticated blockchain-based RPG that seamlessly integrates traditional gaming mechanics with DeFi elements. Built on modular smart contract architecture, it offers a rich gaming experience with secure, efficient, and extensible systems.

### Key Features

- **Advanced Character System**: Dynamic progression, multi-class support, and deep customization
- **Innovative Economy**: AMM-based trading, crafting, and resource management
- **Unique Companions**: ERC721-based pets and mounts with evolution mechanics
- **Complex Abilities**: Flexible skill system with combos and synergies
- **Dynamic Equipment**: ERC1155-based items with quality and enhancement systems
- **DeFi Integration**: Yield farming, liquidity provision, and staking rewards

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) for development and testing
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lcanady/dnd.git
cd dnd

# Install Foundry dependencies
forge install

# Install development tools
npm install -g solhint prettier prettier-plugin-solidity slither-analyzer

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Build contracts
forge build

# Run tests
forge test
```

### Development Setup

1. Configure environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   INFURA_API_KEY=           # Your Infura API key
   PRIVATE_KEY=              # Development wallet private key
   ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=        # For contract verification
   REPORT_GAS=true          # Enable gas reporting
   ```

2. Start local development chain:
   ```bash
   anvil
   ```

3. Deploy contracts:
   ```bash
   forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url localhost --broadcast
   ```
