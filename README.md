- Various item types with unique stats and bonuses
- Special abilities and effects
- Equipment enhancement and modification

### Quest System (Quest.sol)
- Various quests with different difficulty levels
- Stat requirements for quest participation
- Token rewards for completion

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v14+
- Foundry
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lcanady/dnd.git
cd dnd
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
forge install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values:
# - PRIVATE_KEY: Your deployment wallet private key
# - VRF_KEY_HASH: Chainlink VRF key hash
# - VRF_COORDINATOR: Chainlink VRF coordinator address
# - VRF_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: Your Chainlink VRF subscription ID
```

4. Run tests:

```bash
forge test
```

### Deployment
Deploy all contracts:

```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

## üîß Development

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run specific test file
forge test --match-path test/Character.t.sol

# Run with verbosity for debugging
forge test -vv
```

### Contract Verification
After deployment, verify contracts on Etherscan:

```bash
forge verify-contract [CONTRACT_ADDRESS] [CONTRACT_NAME] --chain-id [CHAIN_ID] --api-key [ETHERSCAN_API_KEY]
```
