# Security Considerations

Security is paramount in smart contract development, especially in a GameFi project like DeFi & Dragons involving valuable assets (NFTs, tokens). This document outlines key security considerations, practices, and known risks.

## Core Security Principles

*   **Minimize Attack Surface:** Keep contracts simple. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
*   **Use Standard, Audited Libraries:** Leverage battle-tested libraries like OpenZeppelin for common patterns (ERC20, ERC721, AccessControl, ReentrancyGuard, Pausable).
*   **Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern:** Perform checks first, update state (effects), then interact with external contracts.
*   **Fail Securely:** Ensure contracts revert and halt execution when unexpected conditions occur.
*   **Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to addresses and contracts.

## Common Vulnerabilities & Mitigations

*   **Reentrancy:**
    *   **Mitigation:** Use OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` (`nonReentrant` modifier) on functions involving external calls after state changes. Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions.
*   **Integer Overflow/Underflow:**
    *   **Mitigation:** Use Solidity 0.8.0+ which has built-in checks. For older versions or assembly, use `SafeMath` or equivalent libraries.
*   **Access Control Issues:**
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust access control using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` or `Ownable`. Clearly define roles (e.g., `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, `MINTER_ROLE`, `PAUSER_ROLE`, `UPGRADER_ROLE`) and ensure sensitive functions have appropriate `onlyRole` or `onlyOwner` modifiers.
*   **Front-Running / Miner Extractable Value (MEV):**
    *   **Mitigation:** Be aware of MEV implications for sensitive actions like DEX interactions or NFT mints with predictable elements. Consider commit-reveal schemes, batching, or using MEV-aware infrastructure if necessary.
*   **Timestamp Dependence:**
    *   **Mitigation:** Avoid relying on `block.timestamp` for critical logic that can be manipulated by miners within a small range. Use `block.number` for ordering if needed, but be aware of its limitations.
*   **Gas Limit Issues / Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Mitigation:** Avoid unbounded loops (e.g., iterating over large arrays in storage). Use pull-over-push patterns for payments/withdrawals. Implement gas limits in contract interactions where feasible.
*   **Oracle Manipulation:**
    *   **Mitigation:** Use reliable oracle solutions like Chainlink for external data (e.g., price feeds). Avoid relying on single-source or easily manipulated on-chain data (like DEX spot prices) for critical logic.
*   **Logic Errors:**
    *   **Mitigation:** Extensive testing (unit, integration, fuzzing), formal verification (where applicable), code reviews, and external audits.
*   **Upgradeability Risks:**
    *   **Mitigation:** Secure the upgrade mechanism (multisig, timelock). Ensure storage layout compatibility. Thoroughly test upgrades (see [Upgradeability Guide](./upgradeability.md)).

## Development & Testing Practices

*   **Comprehensive Test Suite:** High test coverage using Foundry (`forge test`), including unit, integration, and fork tests.
*   **Fuzz Testing:** Use Foundry's fuzzing capabilities to uncover edge cases.
*   **Static Analysis:** Regularly run tools like Slither (`slither .`) to automatically detect potential issues.
*   **Linter:** Use `solhint` to enforce style guides and catch common errors.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct peer reviews for all code changes.
*   **Environment Consistency:** Ensure testing environments (local, testnet) mimic mainnet conditions as closely as possible.

## Deployment & Operational Security

*   **Secure Private Key Management:** Use hardware wallets or secure key management services (like Gnosis Safe for multisig) for deployer and admin keys. **Never store plain private keys in code or unsecured files.**
*   **Deployment Verification:** Verify contract source code on block explorers (Etherscan, PolygonScan, etc.).
*   **Use Testnets:** Deploy and test thoroughly on public testnets (e.g., Sepolia) before mainnet deployment.
*   **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring for key contract events and functions on mainnet to detect anomalies.
*   **Incident Response Plan:** Have a plan in place for how to react to security incidents (e.g., pausing contracts, notifying users, performing emergency upgrades).
*   **Pausable Mechanism:** Implement OpenZeppelin's `Pausable` for critical functions to allow temporary halting in emergencies.
*   **Access Control Management:** Carefully manage admin roles. Use timelocks for significant changes.

## Audits

*   **External Audits:** Engage reputable third-party security auditors to review the codebase before mainnet launch and after significant upgrades.
*   **Bug Bounties:** Consider running a bug bounty program (e.g., via Immunefi) to incentivize white-hat hackers to find vulnerabilities.

## Known Risks & Trade-offs

*(Document any specific risks inherent to the project's design or dependencies)*

*   **Oracle Reliance:** Dependency on Chainlink or other oracles introduces trust in the oracle network.
*   **Centralization Risks:** Degree of centralization in admin controls (e.g., upgradeability, parameter setting). Acknowledge trade-offs between security, usability, and decentralization.
*   **Composability Risks:** Interactions with external DeFi protocols introduce dependencies on their security and uptime.
*   **Economic Exploits:** Potential for exploits targeting the game's economic model (e.g., manipulating token prices, reward mechanisms).

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

*(Provide a clear channel for security researchers to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities)*

*   **Contact:** security@yourproject.com (Example)
*   **Bug Bounty Program:** Link to bug bounty platform if applicable.
