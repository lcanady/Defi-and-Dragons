# üìö The Ancient Scrolls: API Reference

Welcome, developer-adventurer, to the collected knowledge of the DeFi & Dragons smart contracts! These scrolls detail the interfaces and functions that power our realm.

Use the `GameFacade` as your primary entry point for most interactions. Below are links to the detailed API references for each major system.

## Core Systems

*   **[Game Facade (`GameFacade.sol`)](./game-facade.md)**
    *   The central gateway providing simplified access to all major game functions, including character creation, equipment management, quest interactions, marketplace actions, and DeFi integrations.

*   **[Character (`Character.sol`)](./character.md)**
    *   Manages the Character NFTs (ERC721), their core stats (Strength, Agility, Magic), state (Level, Health), and the creation of dedicated `CharacterWallet` contracts.

*   **[Equipment (`Equipment.sol`)](./equipment.md)**

    *   Manages battle mechanics:
        *   **`CombatDamageCalculator.sol`**: Calculates base damage from stats and equipment.
        *   **`CombatActions.sol`**: Handles specific combat moves triggered by actions, battle state, combos, and critical hits.
