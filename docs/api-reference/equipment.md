function createEquipment(
    string calldata name,
    string calldata description,
    uint8 strengthBonus,
    uint8 agilityBonus,
    uint8 magicBonus,
    Types.Alignment statAffinity, // Alignment that benefits most from this item
    uint256 amount // Note: Amount currently unused in ID generation

```typescript
// Assuming caller has MINTER_ROLE
const equipmentId = await equipment.createEquipment(
    \"Dragon\'s Blade\",
    \"A mighty sword forged in dragon\'s breath\",
    5,  // +5 strength
    2,  // +2 agility
    0,  // No magic bonus
    Types.Alignment.STRENGTH, // Favors Strength alignment

## Special Abilities üåü

Equipment can have special abilities that trigger under specific conditions during combat or gameplay. Each ability has a name, description, trigger condition, effect type, and cooldown period.

### getSpecialAbility
```solidity
function getSpecialAbility(uint256 equipmentId, uint256 abilityIndex) external view returns (Types.SpecialAbility memory)
```
Retrieves a specific special ability of an equipment type.

  - `triggerValue`: Threshold value for the trigger condition
  - `effectType`: Type of effect (DAMAGE_BOOST, HEALING_BOOST, DEFENSE_BOOST)
  - `effectValue`: Magnitude of the effect
  - `cooldown`: Number of rounds before ability can be used again

**Example:**
```typescript
const ability = await equipment.getSpecialAbility(equipmentId, 0);
console.log("Ability Name:", ability.name);
console.log("Trigger:", ability.triggerCondition);
console.log("Effect:", ability.effectType);
```

### getSpecialAbilities
```solidity
function getSpecialAbilities(uint256 equipmentId) external view returns (Types.SpecialAbility[] memory)
```
Retrieves all special abilities of an equipment type.

**Parameters:**
- `equipmentId`: The equipment type ID

**Returns:**
- Array of all `SpecialAbility` structs for this equipment

**Example:**
```typescript
const abilities = await equipment.getSpecialAbilities(equipmentId);
for (const ability of abilities) {
    console.log(`${ability.name}: ${ability.description}`);
}
```

### checkTriggerCondition
```solidity
function checkTriggerCondition(
    uint256 characterId,
    uint256 equipmentId,
    uint256 abilityIndex,
    uint256 currentRound
) external view returns (bool)
```
Checks if a special ability can be triggered based on its cooldown.

**Parameters:**
- `characterId`: The character attempting to use the ability
- `equipmentId`: The equipment with the ability
- `abilityIndex`: Index of the ability to check
- `currentRound`: Current combat round number

**Returns:**
- `bool`: True if the ability can be triggered (cooldown has expired)

**Example:**
```typescript
const canTrigger = await equipment.checkTriggerCondition(
    characterId,
    equipmentId,
    0,  // First ability
    currentRound

    string description;
    Types.TriggerCondition triggerCondition; // e.g., ON_LOW_HEALTH
    uint256 triggerValue;
    Types.EffectType effectType; // e.g., DAMAGE_BOOST
    uint256 effectValue;
    uint256 cooldown; // In rounds/turns
}
```

### TriggerCondition
```solidity
enum TriggerCondition {
    NONE,
    ON_LOW_HEALTH,    // Triggers when health below threshold
    ON_HIGH_DAMAGE,   // Triggers when damage taken above threshold
    ON_CONSECUTIVE_HITS  // Triggers after X consecutive hits
}
```

### EffectType
```solidity
enum EffectType {
    NONE,
    DAMAGE_BOOST,    // Increases damage dealt
    HEALING_BOOST,   // Increases healing received
    DEFENSE_BOOST    // Increases defense
}
```

## Error Messages üö´

```solidity
"Equipment does not exist"     // When accessing invalid equipment
"Equipment not active"         // When minting disabled equipment
"Invalid ability index"        // When accessing invalid special ability
"Only character contract"      // When unauthorized contract calls
"Invalid character contract"   // When setting invalid character contract
```

## Best Practices üí°

1. **Equipment Creation**
   - Balance stat bonuses for game balance
   - Provide clear names and descriptions
   - Consider special ability combinations
   - Design abilities that complement different playstyles

2. **Equipment Management**
   - Track active/inactive status
   - Monitor equipment distribution
   - Handle ability cooldowns properly
   - Test ability triggers thoroughly

3. **Gas Optimization**
   - Batch mint operations when possible
   - Cache equipment stats for frequent access
   - Use view functions for queries
   - Consider cooldown timing in ability design
