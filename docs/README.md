## Game Design Document (GDD) - Implemented Features (v0.2)

This GDD reflects the features and mechanics observed from the codebase review.

### 1. Introduction & Vision

*   **Title:** DeFi & Dragons
*   **Concept:** A blockchain-based RPG where player characters (NFTs) engage in quests and combat, with core gameplay mechanics driven by the player's real DeFi actions on associated protocols. Progress involves acquiring better NFT equipment, completing quests tied to combat or DeFi activity, and earning token rewards.
*   **Genre:** RPG, GameFi, Action-Triggered Combat.
*   **Platform:** Web Browser (implied by documentation examples).
*   **Target Chain:** EVM-compatible (likely L2/Sidechain due to gas optimization focus).
*   **Core Pillars:** NFT Characters & Equipment, DeFi Action-Driven Combat, Questing System, On-Chain Rewards.

### 2. Gameplay Mechanics

*   **Core Loop:**
    1.  **Mint/Acquire:** Obtain a Character NFT (`Character.sol`).
    2.  **Quest:** Accept quests (`Quest.sol`, `CombatQuest.sol`, `ProtocolQuest.sol`) which may involve defeating monsters or performing DeFi actions.
    3.  **DeFi Action / Combat:** Perform actions on integrated DeFi protocols (e.g., trading, providing liquidity). These actions are validated (`ActionCombatManager.sol`) and trigger combat "Moves" (`CombatActions.sol`) that deal damage to quest targets, influenced by character stats and equipment. Direct combat (e.g., Boss Fights in `CombatQuest.sol`) involves using abilities (`CombatAbilities.sol`) and calculating damage (`CombatDamageCalculator.sol`).
    4.  **Reward:** Complete quests or defeat monsters to earn token rewards (`GameToken`) and potentially Equipment NFTs (`ItemDrop.sol`).
    5.  **Farm/Stake:** Stake tokens in `ResourceFarm.sol` to earn resource tokens.
    6.  **Equip/Trade:** Equip better gear (`Equipment.sol`) obtained via drops or purchased on the `Marketplace.sol` to improve combat effectiveness.
    7.  **Repeat:** Take on harder quests and engage further with DeFi protocols.
*   **RPG Elements:**
    *   **Character:** ERC721 NFTs (`Character.sol`) with randomized base stats (Strength, Agility, Magic) determined at mint using `ProvableRandom.sol`. Characters have a Level and Alignment. Each character has an associated `CharacterWallet.sol` for managing items. *Note: Base stats appear fixed after minting in current contracts; $GOLD training mentioned in docs is not implemented.*
    *   **Combat System:** Primarily driven by off-chain DeFi actions triggering on-chain combat moves (`ActionCombatManager`, `CombatActions`). Damage scales with the DeFi `actionValue` and character/weapon stats (`CombatDamageCalculator`). A separate system (`CombatAbilities`) handles elemental damage, status effects, and combos, used within specific `CombatQuest` encounters (e.g., Boss Fights). Critical hits are possible (`
