# DeFi & Dragons Tutorial

Welcome to the DeFi & Dragons tutorial! This guide will walk you through the essential first steps to start playing.

**Assumptions:**

*   You have completed the [Installation Guide](./installation.md).
*   You have set up your wallet following the [Wallet Setup Guide](./wallet-setup.md).
*   Your wallet is connected to the correct network and funded with necessary gas tokens (and potentially starter game tokens, depending on the setup).
*   You have the game interface (web app, client, etc.) running or accessible.

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet to the Game

1.  Open the DeFi & Dragons game interface.
2.  Click the "Connect Wallet" button.
3.  Select your configured wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and approve the connection.
4.  Your wallet address should appear, confirming the connection.

## Step 2: Acquire Your First Character

*(This step highly depends on your game's mechanics. Adjust accordingly.)*

*   **Option A: Minting a New Character:**
    *   Navigate to the "Character Creation" or "Mint Character" section.
    *   Customize your character's appearance or stats if applicable.
    *   Click the "Mint" or "Create" button.
    *   Your wallet will prompt you to confirm the transaction (this might involve paying gas fees and potentially a minting fee in game tokens or native currency).
    *   Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain.
    *   Your new character NFT should appear in your wallet and the game interface.
*   **Option B: Receiving a Starter Character:**
    *   Perhaps new players are automatically assigned or can claim a basic character.
    *   Navigate to the "Claim Character" or "My Characters" section.
    *   Follow the prompts to claim or view your initial character.

## Step 3: Exploring the Game World (Basic Interaction)

*(Provide a simple first action a player can take.)*

1.  **View Your Character:** Go to the character screen to see their stats, equipment (if any), and inventory.
2.  **Enter the Main Game Area:** Navigate to the town square, world map, or starting zone.
3.  **Perform a Basic Action:**
    *   *Example: Talk to an NPC:* Find a non-player character (NPC) marked with an interaction icon. Click on them to initiate dialogue.
    *   *Example: Gather a Resource:* Find a resource node (e.g., a mining spot, a tree). Click on it and confirm the action (might be an on-chain or off-chain action).
    *   *Example: Enter a Tutorial Quest/Combat:* Look for a starting quest giver or a low-level combat zone.

## Step 4: Understanding Key UI Elements

*   Briefly point out essential parts of the user interface:
    *   Character status (HP, MP, etc.)
    *   Inventory
    *   Map
    *   Quest log
    *   Chat
    *   Settings
    *   DeFi interaction panel (staking, LP, etc.)

## Step 5: First DeFi Interaction (Optional)

*(If applicable, guide the user through a very basic DeFi action integrated into the game.)*

*   *Example: Staking introductory $GOLD:* 
    *   Navigate to the in-game "Bank" or "Staking" interface.
    *   Select the option to stake $GOLD.
    *   Enter a small amount.
    *   Approve the $GOLD spending limit via your wallet.
    *   Confirm the staking transaction via your wallet.
    *   Observe the staked amount and potential rewards interface.
