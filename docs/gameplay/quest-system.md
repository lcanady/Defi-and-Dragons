# Quest System

This document outlines the quest system in DeFi & Dragons, covering how players discover, undertake, and complete quests.

## Discovering Quests

Players can find quests through various means:

*   **NPCs:** Non-Player Characters in towns, villages, or out in the world may offer quests, often marked with an indicator (e.g., an exclamation mark).
*   **Job Boards:** Centralized boards in major settlements might list available tasks or bounties.
*   **Item Triggers:** Finding a specific item might initiate a quest related to it.
*   **Exploration:** Entering certain areas or interacting with specific objects might trigger environmental quests.
*   **Events:** Time-limited or world events may introduce unique questlines.
*   **Main Story Progression:** Core quests that guide the player through the game's narrative.

## Quest Types

DeFi & Dragons features several types of quests:

*   **Main Story Quests:** Progress the central narrative of the game.
*   **Side Quests:** Optional quests offering additional lore, rewards, or challenges.
*   **Repeatable Quests:** Quests that can be completed multiple times, often for grinding resources or reputation (e.g., daily/weekly quests).
*   **Collection Quests:** Require players to gather a certain number of specific items.
*   **Kill Quests:** Require players to defeat a certain number of specific enemies.
*   **Escort Quests:** Protect an NPC while they travel from one point to another.
*   **Delivery Quests:** Transport an item from one NPC/location to another.
*   **Dungeon Quests:** Quests specifically related to completing activities within a dungeon.
*   **PvP Quests:** Objectives related to player-vs-player combat.
*   **DeFi-Related Quests:** Tasks involving staking, providing liquidity, trading specific tokens, etc., integrated into the game world.

## Accepting and Tracking Quests

*   **Acceptance:** Typically involves interacting with the quest giver (NPC, object) and agreeing to take on the task.
*   **Quest Log:** An in-game interface where players can view their active quests.
    *   Displays quest objectives, descriptions, locations, and rewards.
    *   Allows players to track or untrack quests (potentially showing indicators on the map/UI).
    *   May categorize quests (Main, Side, Repeatable, etc.).

## Quest Objectives

Objectives clearly state what needs to be done to complete the quest. Examples:

*   "Defeat 10 Goblins in the Whispering Woods."
*   "Collect 5 Moonpetal Flowers."
*   "Speak to Elder Rowan in Rivertown."
*   "Deliver this package to the Blacksmith."
*   "Clear the Shadow Crypt dungeon."
*   "Stake at least 100 $GOLD in the Royal Bank."

## Completing Quests

1.  **Fulfill Objectives:** Perform all the required tasks listed in the quest log.
2.  **Return to Quest Giver (Usually):** Most quests require returning to the NPC or location where the quest was initiated.
3.  **Turn-In:** Interact with the quest giver/object to report completion.
4.  **Receive Rewards:** Rewards are granted upon successful completion.

## Quest Rewards

Completing quests grants various rewards, including:

*   **Experience Points (EXP):** For character leveling.
*   **Currency:** $GOLD or other in-game currencies.
*   **Items:** Equipment (weapons, armor), consumables (potions), crafting materials.
*   **NFTs:** Potential for unique NFT rewards (equipment, cosmetic items, character unlocks).
*   **Reputation:** Increase standing with specific factions or NPCs.
*   **Skill Points/Unlocks:** Access to new abilities or progression paths.
*   **Story Progression:** Unlocking new areas, characters, or parts of the narrative.
*   **DeFi Tokens/Yields:** Directly rewarding DeFi assets or boosting participation yield.

## Quest Chains and Storylines

*   Some quests are part of longer chains, where completing one unlocks the next.
*   These often form significant side stories or the main game narrative.

## On-Chain vs. Off-Chain Quests

*(Specify the balance between on-chain and off-chain elements)*

*   **Likely Off-Chain:** Quest discovery, dialogue, tracking simple objectives (kill counts, basic collection), standard EXP/currency rewards.
*   **Likely On-Chain:** Accepting/completing quests with significant NFT or token rewards, quests involving direct interaction with DeFi protocols (staking, LPing), major storyline milestones.
*   **Hybrid:** Off-chain completion triggers an on-chain reward transaction.
